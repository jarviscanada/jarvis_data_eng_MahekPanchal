# Introduction:
summary: "I'd describe myself as a curious individual, always eager to embrace new knowledge.My passion for understanding technology and its workings led me to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from LJ University in India.Following graduation, I ventured to Canada for my postgraduate studies in Web Development at Conestoga College.Over the past two years in Canada, I've engaged in various part-time roles that have helped me refine my communication and interpersonal skills.During my final year of undergrad studies, I started working as a Software Development intern.I participated in hands-on projects, collaborated with diverse teams, and explored new frameworks like Spring Boot and Tensorflow.Currently, I'm employed as a Software Engineer at Jarvis, where I have the opportunity to develop MVPs, deploy them, and continuously expand my skill set by learning new technologies and tools.Beyond work, I find joy in listening to music while taking walks."
