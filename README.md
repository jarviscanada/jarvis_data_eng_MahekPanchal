# Mahek Panchal . Jarvis Consulting

I'd describe myself as a curious individual, always eager to embrace new knowledge. My passion for understanding technology and its workings led me to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from LJ University in India. Following graduation, I ventured to Canada for my postgraduate studies in Web Development at Conestoga College. Over the past two years in Canada, I've engaged in various part-time roles that have helped me refine my communication and interpersonal skills. During my final year of undergrad studies, I started working as a Software Development intern. I participated in hands-on projects, collaborated with diverse teams, and explored new frameworks like Spring Boot and Tensorflow. Currently, I'm employed as a Software Engineer at Jarvis, where I have the opportunity to develop MVPs, deploy them, and continuously expand my skill set by learning new technologies and tools. Beyond work, I find joy in listening to music while taking walks.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahekPanchal](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahekPanchal)


**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahekPanchal/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Cluster Resource Monitoring Application using Linux CentOS. Created bash scripts capable of retrieving hardware specifications and node resource usage. Real-time data was gathered using the crontab feature and stored in a Postgres database deployed within a Docker container.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahekPanchal/tree/master/core_java)]: Grep App: Created a Java application that emulates the functionality of the Linux grep command. This application enables users to recursively search for a specified text pattern within a designated directory and save the matched lines to a file.


## Highlighted Projects
**Influencer Management System**: Created a user-friendly web application that enabled influencers to easily access information from the portal and create compelling content for impactful marketing campaigns endorsed by the registered brands. Deployed the system based on the MERN, utilizing AWS EC2, S3, and SNS services. Detected and analyzed user behavior patterns among registered influencers to ensure robust system security and integrity.

**Hygiene Surveillance**: Built a Hygiene Surveillance system in Java to identify whether restaurant staff were adhering to safety protocols by wearing gloves and masks during food preparation amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Employed TensorFlow and Computer Vision for training AI models, and the resulting data was stored in a database.
